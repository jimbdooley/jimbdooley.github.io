		This is a project that is still in its "proof of concept" phase. The goal is to get to a point where a person can scan a playing card (like Magic: the Gathering) and immediately have it listed on eBay with almost no additional work. It's quite a fun project because there is a lot of interesting math in the many steps of image processing. The code is on my desktop, I can upload it to Github later if anyone wants to see it. It's written in Java on android studio.

		This is an animation of a maximum matching algorithm. As part of the hiring process for Google I had to solve a lot of challenging problems, the maximum matching problem was the hardest and most memorable for me. Code for the algorithm is on Github in Python and Javascript.

	I wanted to communicate with the lego power functions from my personal computer devices. I studied the IR protocol of Lego's product and made a simple sample program to show how it works. The code is on Github, and may be useful to some. In the meantime here is proof that it works.
